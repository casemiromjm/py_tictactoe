# Tic Tac Toe game but in Python!

This will be a little project for implementing the old tic tac toe game in python. The first version of it will be only playable through the terminal, but in the future I intend to create a GUI and an executable :)

After started doing the game, I realized that the computer might be a little dumb I can't make it understand the game scenario and choose the best move (yet). Also, I should implement 2 variants of the game, 1 of them being you against the computer and the other one being 2 people against each other. As I said before, the first version will be the computer going against your ~~in a dumb way lol~~.

### Comments on the files
I created the *base_funcs.py* as a way to facilitate my work in the future, since it gathers all the base functions to the game.

### Verions of the game
- Version 1:
    In this version the game it's playable, but, as I said before, the computer is dumb and it's playable only in the terminal
